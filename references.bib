    abstract="Body Biasing Injection (BBI), compared to other injection techniques, is quite recent. It consists in applying a voltage pulse onto the backside surface of an integrated circuit with a needle. Despite its simplicity, and probably because of its recentness, there is very little knowledge on how faults occur, nor as on the characteristics of this injection technique. Within this context, this paper provides insights about the interest of thinning the substrate of ICs in order to enhance the efficiency of BBI as well as its spatial resolution. Those insights were obtained both by experiment and simulation. As a result, elements for simulating the propagation of a perturbation are provided.",

    abstract={Electromagnetic (EM) waves have been recently pointed out as a medium for fault injection within integrated circuits (IC). Indeed, it has been experimentally demonstrated that an EM pulse (EMP), produced with a high-voltage pulse generator and an injector similar to that used to perform EM analyses, was susceptible to create faults exploitable from a cryptanalysis viewpoint. An analysis of the induced faults revealed that they originated from timing constraint violations. In this context, this paper demonstrates that EM injection, performed with enhanced injectors, can produce not only timing faults but also bit-set and bit-reset faults on an IC at rest. This first result clearly extends the range of the threats associated with EM fault injection. It then demonstrates, considering two different ICs under operation: an FPGA and a modern microcontroller, that faults produced by EMP injection are not timing faults but correspond to a different model which is presented in this paper. This model allows to explain experimental results introduced in all former communications.},

    abstract = {In state-of-the-art design paradigm, time, space and power efficiency are considered the primary design constraints. Quite often, this approach adversely impacts the security of the overall system, especially when security is adopted as a countermeasure after some vulnerability is identified. In this position paper, we motivate the idea that security should also be considered as an architectural design constraint in addition to time, space and power. We show that security and efficiency objectives along the three design axes of time, space and power are in fact tightly coupled while identifying that security stands in direct contrast with them across all layers of architectural design. We attempt to prove our case utilizing a proof-by-evidence approach wherein we refer to various works across literature that explicitly imply the eternal conflict between security and efficiency. Thus, security has to be treated as a design constraint from the very beginning. Additionally, we advocate a security-aware design flow starting from the choice of cryptographic primitives, protocols and system design.}
