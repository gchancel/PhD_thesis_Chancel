\label{chap5faultModel}
Thanks to the previous observations, drawn with the extended simulation flow results, I can now discuss a fault model for body biasing injection, similar to what has been made in the past concerning \emfi or \lfi.
According to my observations concerning the simulation results, I have got evidence that the faults induces thanks to \bbi are data-dependent.
This is because bit set/reset fault models are data-dependent.
Indeed, lowering the voltage of a logic gate outputting a low logical value, or increasing the voltage of a logic gate outputting a high logical value, has theoretically no effect on the logic being targeted.
As I have shown in the last section, we can observe bit set/reset faults in logic gates subject to \bbi.
In addition to this, and thanks to the results of the previous chapter concerning the voltage concentration, \bbi effects are seemingly very local, depending on the spreading of the charges inside the substrate.
As Fig. \ref{subfig_isubConc} and Fig. \ref{subfig_isubConcTW} have shown concerning both \dwF and \twF substrates, charges spread in majority in the direction of the probe targets.
