\label{chap5:sect:summary}
This chapter introduces a fault model for BBI, explaining how and why faults occur in ICs subject to body biasing injection.
With chapter \ref{chap:3icModeling}'s electrical models as a basis, it allows explaining how electrical charges displacement in the IC during a BBI pulse allows changing logic gates output values.
Therefore, if an attacker has the ability to finely control these disturbances, they can target critical time.
In order to verify the correctness of this analysis, both substrate charges propagation and logic gates behavior study are conducted.
