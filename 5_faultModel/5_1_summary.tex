\section{Summary}
\label{chap5:sect:summary}
This last chapter introduces a fault model for BBI, explaining how and why faults occur in ICs subject to body biasing injection.
Thanks to the electrical models proposed in Chapter \ref{chap:3icModeling} and to further logic gates simulation, it is possible to present a physical understanding of fault creation.
