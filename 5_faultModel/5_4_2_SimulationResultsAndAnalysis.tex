\subsection{\twF substrate results and analysis}
In the first place, let me introduce the \twF results.
The corresponding schematic is the one displayed in Fig. \ref{fig_ivxSig}, and its simulation results are shown in Fig. \ref{fig_ivxTriple}.
The disturbance signals are extracted from the previous chapter \twF \scs simulation.
Let us remember that the coupling between the probe and the modeled IC is purely capacitive in that scenario.
