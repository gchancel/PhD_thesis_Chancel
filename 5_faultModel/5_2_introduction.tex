\label{chap5:sect:intro}
To further complete the understanding of BBI, in addition to having a reliable model to predict IC behavior, it is of great importance of having a precise fault model, in order to be able to set up countermeasures.
Indeed, the main objective of studying fault injection techniques is to protect secured ICs.
As it has been said in Chapter \ref{chap:3icModeling}, simulating at a transistor level an entire IC is unrealistic computationally speaking.
Therefore, and because the previous models do not represent the logical functions of ICs, we propose an additional step to the simulation workflow proposed in Chapter \ref{chap:3icModeling}.
It allows appreciating logic gates behavior under BBI disturbances in order to get a deeper and more precise understanding of both electrical and functional fault creation.
