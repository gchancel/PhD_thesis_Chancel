\label{chap5_concl}
Eventually, my work can be put in perspective to what has been observed concerning laser fault injection in \cite{lfiFaultModel}.
This work has shown that \lfi can induce data dependent faults and single bit faults.
Data dependent faults can help attackers by providing additional information on the nature of the data manipulated by the IC target.
\lfi is also a very precise  fault injection method which does not spread out very much of the injection point.
To put it all in perspective with my thesis, in the second chapter, I presented a \dfa relying on a single-bit fault model and have proven to successfully perform it using \bbi.
Then, thanks to the modeling of \bbi I have set up, I have shown that \bbi induce bit set/reset faults which are data dependent.
In addition to this, thanks to the \scs simulations, I have shown that most of the electric charges concentrate under the injection point, which can be put in parallel to the local nature of laser fault injection.
