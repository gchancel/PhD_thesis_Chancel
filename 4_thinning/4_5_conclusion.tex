\section{Conclusion \ddc}
This chapter introduced the interest of thinning the substrate of integrated circuits on Body Biasing Injection efficiency.
In the first place, we studied thanks to a geometrical approach the potential benefits of this practice, further completed with electrical simulations.
The geometric approach brought mathematical relations allowing to evaluate preliminary the effects of thinning the substrate of a target IC.
