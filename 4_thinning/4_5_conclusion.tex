In this chapter, I introduced the interest of thinning the substrate of integrated circuits when performing Body Biasing Injection.
In the first place, I presented a geometric approach which allowed me to take a step back from electric simulations.
This approach brought mathematical relations allowing to evaluate preliminary the effects of thinning the substrate of a target IC.
Thanks to this approach, I drew three conclusions on the implications of substrate thinning on \bbi.
Then, thanks to the previous simulation flow introduced in Chapter \ref{chap:3icModeling}, I performed simulations allowing me to complete the geometric approach.
This allowed me to verify the soundness of the geometric conclusions.
After that, I introduced substrate thinning in practice, including a quick look of the tools commonly used.
Eventually, I presented practical experiments on actual thinned ICs, and I was able to verify the soundness of both the geometric and electric approaches.
