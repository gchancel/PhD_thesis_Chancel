\section{Summary \ddc}
This chapter proposes to study the interests of thinning the substrate of integrated circuits with the aim to enhance Body Biasing Injection efficiency.
First, we are going to present a geometrical approach in order to appreciate the effects of substrate thinning on ICs behaviors.
Second, thanks to the models presented in Chapter \ref{chap:3icModeling}, we are going to analyze theoretically the effects of substrate thinning.
Eventually, in order to verify the soundness of the geometric approach and the simulation results, experiments are going to be studied thanks to the analysis of the same IC with different substrate thicknesses.
