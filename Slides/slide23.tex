    \vspace{4mm}
    \large
    BBI injects or absorbs charges from the probe up to the power delivery network\\
    \vspace{6mm}
    The resulting current charges or discharges the logic gates output\\
    \vspace{6mm}
    \large
    BBI → electron vacuum cleaner\\
    \vspace{6mm}
    \large
    Data dependent faults → can BBI be used to perform safe-error attack?
