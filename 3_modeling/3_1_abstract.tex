\section{Summary \ddc}
This chapter presents the work carried out concerning the modeling and simulation of integrated circuits and platforms in a body biasing fault injection context.
The presented work focused on elaborating electrical models allowing to evaluate with simulations the behaviors of ICs subjected to BBI.
The chapter introduces the elaborated models and the algorithms used to create them, and then goes on to present various validation steps to check the meaningfulness of the models.
Parts of this work have been published both in \cite{mybbiCosade} and \cite{mybbiFdtc2022}.
