\section{Enhanced BBI platform in a fault attack context \ddc}
\label{chap:2_goodPractices;sect:enhancedBBIGiraudAttack}
Now that we have seen with simple actual experiments the benefits of the proposed enhanced \bbi platform, let us linger on further experiments to verify more thoroughly the soundness of these enhancements.
To that end, I performed a differential fault attack on our IC target.
More specifically, a constraining fault attack requiring single bit faults on one or more bytes working on an AES cryptographic core, introduced by C. Giraud \cite{giraudDfa} in 2004.
