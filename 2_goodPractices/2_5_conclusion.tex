\section{Conclusion \ddc}
\label{chap:2_goodPractices;sect:conclusion}
In this chapter, we first discussed the hardware and software commonly used for the practice of BBI, as well as presenting our hardware and software.
We then proposed an enhanced platform for the practice of BBI, consisting of reducing the ground impedance and approximating the voltage pulse generator impedance matching.
We first studied these enhancements using a coarse platform.
Furthermore, we then performed analog experiments using real hardware.
In order to further verify the soundness of the BBI platform improvements, we set up and conducted a Giraud's differential fault attack.
We observed that it would be impossible to conduct the attack without the aforementioned BBI platform enhancements, thus confirming their usefulness.
