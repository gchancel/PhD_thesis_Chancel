\section{Giraud's differential fault attack \ddc}
\label{chap2:dfaGiraud}
Now that we have seen the benefits of the proposed practice with a simple experiment, it is required, to further support these benefits, to conduct in-depth experiments.
To that end, we propose to compare the conduct and outcome of a differential fault attack, specifically the mono-bit Giraud's DFA as defined in the third section of \cite{giraudDfa}.
