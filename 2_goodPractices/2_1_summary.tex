\section{Summary \ddc}
\label{chap2:summary}
This chapter first introduces multiple concepts, hardware and tools which are used and mentioned all along the work.
Afterward, as its name implies, it brings forward better practices for Body Biasing Injection.
%This chapter first presents the platform used during all the work.
%Then, it brings forward better practices for Body Biasing Injection.
It aims at introducing them with theoretical examples in addition to practical demonstrations.
To that end, we propose to analyze different BBI platform scenarios thanks to coarse electrical models, allowing us to analyze their drawbacks and advantages in order to introduce the proposed enhancements.
Eventually, we will present a real differential fault attack on a hardware AES co-processor in order to illustrate the soundness of the proposed improvements.
