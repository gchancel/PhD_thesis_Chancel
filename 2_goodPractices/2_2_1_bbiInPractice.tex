\section{\bbi in practice \ddc}
\label{chap:2_goodPractices;sect:bbiInPractice}
In this section, I am going to describe coarse electrical \bbi platform models.
They will allow us to concisely understand, evaluate and simulate \bbi platforms behavior, limitations and room for improvement.
We will then be able to analyze the platform's performance and point out its weaknesses.

    \subsection{\bbi platform model \ddc}
    \label{chap:2_goodPractices;sect:bbiInPractice;subsect:bbiPlatformModel}
    \input{2_goodPractices/figures/bbiPracticeBadGnd}
    To be able to quickly predict and analyze \bbi platforms, I developed a very simple electrical model, illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:bbiPracticeBadGnd}.
