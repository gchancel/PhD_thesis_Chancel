\section{Body Biasing Injection enhanced practice \ddc}
\label{chap2:goodPractices}
With the platform thoroughly introduced,we can now discuss the BBI practice in the state of the art compared to the enhancements we propose.
\subsection{BBI practice in the state of the art \ddc}
\input{2_goodPractices/figures/bbiPracticeBadGnd}
First and foremost, in order to introduce the proposed enhancements, we will explain the limitations of state of the art BBI practices.
Fig. \ref{fig:bbiPracticeBadGnd} presents an example BBI platform as it is performed in the state of the art.
This schematic only represents the main pieces of equipment, roughly composed of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A voltage pulse generator
    \item A transmission line
    \item A BBI probe
    \item An IC target
    \item A grounding setup
\end{itemize}
In that case, we want to bring forward two limitations of the platform as it stands.
The first one is that most commercially available high voltage generator require a very specific load impedance to be used in order to meet their specifications, thus the \mbox{50 \textOmega} transmission line.
However, the vast majority of integrated circuits substrates do not present at all times and in every location the exact required impedance for a specific generator.
\input{2_goodPractices/figures/bbiPracticeBadGndSignals}
Therefore, there will inevitably be impedance mismatch effects, such as bounces in the transmission line.
These effects are illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:bbiPracticeBadGndSignals}.
As one can notice, due to the bounces, there is a 25 \% undershoot on the pulse received by the target (green signal), in addition to a 100 V overshoot.
It is directly echoed on the IC ground current measurement (purple signal).
However, one might wonder why this can be a problem for the practice of BBI.
The bounces in the transmission line, reflected in the IC current, are then propagated through the IC.
Therefore, because the IC does not present in every substrate location a constant impedance, it is impossible to predict the bounces' shape.
Thus, because an attacker has to achieve precise timing when injecting faults into an IC, and because of this impossibility to reach a certain degree of precision, it is highly problematic in a fault injection context.

The second limitation concerns the platform grounding.
The example platform of Fig. \ref{fig:bbiPracticeBadGnd}
Contrary to impedance mismatching, it is a less predictable issue, as each platform will have extremely different grounding installation.

%The first noticeable one is the imperfect electrical grounding.
%Indeed, on the example platform, one can note the 150 \textOmega ground impedance between each piece of equipment ground and the reference ground.
