\section{Body Biasing Injection enhanced practice \ddc}
\label{chap2:goodPractices}
With the platform thoroughly introduced,we can now discuss the BBI practice in the state of the art compared to the enhancements we propose.
\subsection{BBI practice in the state of the art \ddc}
\input{2_goodPractices/figures/bbiPracticeBadGnd}
First and foremost, in order to introduce the proposed enhancements, we will explain the limitations of state of the art BBI practices.
Fig. \ref{fig:bbiPracticeBadGnd} presents an example BBI platform as it is performed in the state of the art.
This schematic only represents the main pieces of equipment, roughly composed of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A voltage pulse generator
    \item A transmission line
    \item A BBI probe
    \item An IC target
    \item A grounding setup
\end{itemize}
In that case, we want to bring forward two limitations of the platform as it stands.
The first one is that most high voltage generator commercially available require a very specific load impedance to be used in order to meet their specifications, thus the \mbox{50 \textOmega} transmission line.
However, the vast majority of integrated circuits substrates do not present at all times and in every location the exact required impedance for a specific generator.
\input{2_goodPractices/figures/bbiPracticeBadGndSignals}
Therefore, there will inevitably be impedance mismatch effects, such as bounces in the transmission line.
These effects are illustrated in Fig. \ref{fig:bbiPracticeBadGndSignals}.
As one can notice, due to the bounces, there is a 25 \% undershoot on the pulse received by the target (green signal), in addition to a 100 V overshoot.
It is directly echoed on the IC ground current measurement (purple signal).
However, one might wonder why this can be a problem for the practice of BBI.
In fact, because an attacker has to achieve precise timing when injecting faults into an IC
