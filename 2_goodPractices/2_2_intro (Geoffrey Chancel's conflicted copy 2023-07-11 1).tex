\label{chap2:intro}
In the past few years, Body Biasing Injection has been getting more and more attention.
Indeed, it is a low-cost method which requires a low bill of material, roughly compsoed of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A voltage pulse generator
    \item A metallic probe
    \item A target IC
    \item Cables to interconnect equipment
\end{itemize}
The most expensive piece of equipment is definitely the voltage pulse generator.
However, there are low-cost solutions like NewAE ChipSHOUTER for example, which can easily replace high voltage high precision generator in some use cases.
Nonetheless, during this work, the generator used is the AVTECH AVRK-4-B, which a high speed, precise, voltage pulse generator.
It allows generating positive or negative pulses up to 750 V of amplitude with a 4 ns rise or fall time, with pulse width ranging from 6 ns to 20 ns.
