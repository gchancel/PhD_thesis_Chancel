    \caption{\bbi platforms comparison: state-of-the-art (S1P and S1G) versus the proposed enhanced platform (S2P and S2G). The ideal voltage pulse is -140 V ample and 20 ns wide, with rise and fall times of 4 ns. S1P shows a -108 \% negative percentage overshoot. PW is 275 \% too high with a 75 ns value. The fall time is 4 times higher than requested, and the rise time is more than 15 times higher. S1G highlights the ringing, seen on S1P on a lesser extent. On S2P, the voltage set point negative PO measures -31 \%. PW now perfectly matches the set point of 20 ns. Rise and fall times are 4 times higher than they should be, despite both being consistent. S2G shows significant ringing reduction, while maintaining the same amount of transferred energy into the IC.}
