    \caption{\bbi platforms comparison: state-of-the-art (S1P and S1G) versus the proposed enhanced platform (S2P and S2G). Time scales are identical on each waveform, and voltage/current scales are waveform dependent. The ideal voltage pulse has a negative amplitude of 140 V and a pulse width of 20 ns, with rise and fall times of 4 ns. S1P shows a -108 \% voltage undershoot. The pulse width is 275 \% too high with a 75 ns value. The fall time is 4 times higher than requested, and the rise time is more than 15 times higher. S1G highlights specifically the ringing, which could already be seen on S1P, with energy going back and forth multiple times during the pulse. On S2P, the voltage set point error goes from -108 \% to only -31 \%. The pulse width now perfectly matches the set point value of 20 ns. However, rise and fall times are 4 times higher than they should be, despite both being consistent. S2G helps us spot the significant ringing reduction, while maintaining the same amount of transferred energy into the IC.}
