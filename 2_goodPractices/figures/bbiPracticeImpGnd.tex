        \caption{Enhanced simplified electrical model of a \bbi platform. The model represents the major piece of equipment involved in a \bbi platform, with improvements over state-of-the-art ones. There are the voltage pulse generator, the \bbi probe, the transmission line, the IC (1 k\textomega\xspace resistor), the original platform grounding (both 150 \textOmega\xspace resistors), and the proposed enhancements highlighted in red. The enhancements consist in first, creating an approximate impedance matching for the generator, second, to bypass the poor grounding with low impedance copper wires.}

        \caption{Simulation results of the simplified enhanced \bbi platform model. The waveforms colors match the schematic. In blue is the ideal voltage pulse (voltage set point of -150 V, pulse width of 10 ns). In green is the effective pulse received by the IC. In orange is the pulse observed at the generator output, before the transmission line. Eventually, in purple is the IC ground current. The dotted waveforms are the waveforms observed in Fig. \ref{fig:bbiPracticeBadGndSignals} for the state-of-the-art platform, for comparison purposes. The most obvious observed improvements concern the set points, which are fully respected, in addition to the drastic ringing reduction, leading to better temporal control.}
