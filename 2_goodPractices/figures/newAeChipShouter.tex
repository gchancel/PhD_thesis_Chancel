    \caption{PicoEMP: a low-cost pulse generator from NewAE Technology Inc. It provides much less instantaneous power than a typical generator, has a long recovery time (from 1 to 4 seconds), has a lower maximum amplitude (250 V), is not pre-calibrated, and has no controllable pulse width. However, it costs 94 \% less than a typical generator, giving it a considerable advantage when building low-cost \bbi platforms.}
