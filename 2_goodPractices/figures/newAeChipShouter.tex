    \caption{ChipSHOUTER\textregistered-PicoEMP from NewAE Technology Inc.: a low-cost alternative to fast high voltage pulse generator typically used in fault injection platforms. It provides much less instantaneous power than a typical generator (around 99 \% less power), has a long recovery time (from 1 to 4 seconds), has a lower maximum amplitude (250 V), is not calibrated, and has no controllable pulse width. However, it costs 94 \% less than a typical generator, giving it a considerable advantage when building low-cost \bbi platforms.}
