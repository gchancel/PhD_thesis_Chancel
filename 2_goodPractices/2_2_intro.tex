\label{chap2:intro}
In the past few years, Body Biasing Injection has been getting more and more attention.
Indeed, it is a low-cost method which requires a low bill of material, roughly compsoed of:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A voltage pulse generator
    \item A metallic probe
    \item A target IC
    \item Cables to interconnect equipment
\end{itemize}
The most expensive piece of equipment is definitely the voltage pulse generator.
However, there are low-cost solutions like the NewAE ChipSHOUTER for example, which can easily replace high voltage high precision generator in some use cases.

\subsection{Platform equipment}
\label{chap2:intro:platEquip}
This section is dedicated in presenting the different piece of equipment which allowed us to perform this work.
The hardware platform, as well as the different software used are introduced.

%Nonetheless, during this work, the generator used is the AVTECH AVRK-4-B, which a high speed, precise, voltage pulse generator.
%It allows generating positive or negative pulses up to 750 V of amplitude with a 4 ns rise or fall time, with pulse widths ranging from 6 ns to 20 ns.
%It allowed us to finely tune each setting in order to perform reproducible experiments.

%Another very important piece of equipment used for BBI is the probe.
%It simply consists in a metallic tip soldered to an SMA connector.
%However,
