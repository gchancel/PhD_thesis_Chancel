\section{Introduction \ddc}
\label{chap:1;sect:intro}
In our time, almost every business sector and every part of our surroundings, directly or indirectly use integrated electronics circuits.
It ranges from smart-cards to supercomputers, through military devices, cell-phones, Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and Internet-of-Things (IoT) objects to name but a few.

Traditionally, integrated circuits design mainly focused on performance upgrades over the generations.
Performance was measured thanks to two factors: computation speed and silicon surface.
Within this context, power consumption was not a design constraint, therefore, integrated circuits became more and more energy-consuming.
However, with the advent of portable devices, power consumption became a predominant design factor over speed and space and got included into the former design flows.
Nevertheless, physically, less space and more speed does not equate with less energy.
Alongside, new systems have emerged and have massively grown these past decades: IoT and CPS.
On one hand, CPS are often systems where hardware and software are interlaced and thought together, and can be drastically different from one application to another. On the other hand, IoT systems have often less coordination between hardware and software, but are commonly more flexible.
Whatsoever, both of these systems have something strong in common: their security is fundamental.
Therefore, in this context, as it has been proposed in \cite{securityInIcs}, and because security had been adopted as a countermeasure after the design flow, it has to enter as a fourth design rule when creating integrated circuits.
This is required because a secure system as to ensure every data going in and out of it stays undiminished and integral, as well as being protected.
%In the past decades, all devices have been computing more and more things in our lives in order to facilitate and speed up common tasks.
%What has mainly blown up is dematerialized payments, allowing everyone carrying out transactions everywhere at every moment, personal data
