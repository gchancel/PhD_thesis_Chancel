\section{Summary \ddc}
\label{chap:1;sect:summary}
This chapter reviews the state-of-the-art concerning fault injection methods.
It first defines the interest of studying fault injection and its context.
Then, various fault injection techniques are presented and their differences, advantages, and disadvantages are analyzed.
Specifically, platforms equipment across all methods is described alongside the different techniques employed to perform such fault injection.
Eventually, body biasing injection will be introduced, and I will study its interests in a fault injection context.
