\section{Fault-injection attacks \ddc}
\label{chap:1;sect:fattack}
%Now that we have seen the basics of side-channel attacks, we are going to study fault injection techniques commonly described in the literature.
Fault injections are widely described in the literature and can be utilized for a variety of purposes.
For instance, during integrated circuits testing, it is common to find fault injection susceptibility tests, allowing for engineers to test fault detection circuits, recovery capabilities and reconfiguration possibilities of ICs.
In this work, we are going to take a closer look at hardware fault injections (HFI) techniques solely, which fall in two distinct categories, similar to side-channel attacks:
\begin{itemize}
    \item HFI with physical contact
    \item Contactless HFI
\end{itemize}
For each kind of HFI, multiple outcomes are aimed.
On the one hand, the HFI can produce, in the targeted IC, branching errors leading secret codes to be revealed or protected rights to be acquired by an attacker.
On the other hand, HFI can produce incorrect behaviors, allowing to retrieve hidden and protected data thanks to mathematical tools.
In that case, HFI targets are mostly cryptographic algorithms, and can be segmented in non-comprehensive set of categories.

One of the oldest HFI are called differential fault attacks (DFA).
The principle of DFA lies in inducing computation errors during the decryption process of cryptographic algorithm thanks to fault injection.
Several DFAs were proposed on different algorithms \cite{Biham1997DifferentialFA, firstDfaMaybe, ciet_elliptic_2005, dfaEcc, giraudDfa}.

%The simplest HFI consist in analyzing ICs susceptibility or sensitivity to fault injection \cite{yangLiFaultSensitivity}.
%It has the great advantage to allow using the IC as a block box, without knowing the insights on the cryptographic algorithm parameters such as the faulted ciphertext or else the nature of the faults.

%Fault injection attacks can be utilized for a variety of purposes.
%In the first place, we are going to present laser fault injection, as they are very effective, despite being costly.
%After that,
%Eventually, we are going to analyze how body biasing fault injection fits into this field.
