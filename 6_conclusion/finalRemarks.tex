\label{concl_finalremark}
In this thesis manuscript, I presented the various contributions I have worked on concerning \bbi over the past three years.
I have brought electrical models similar to the ones introduced for electromagnetic fault injection a few years ago, alongside a simulation flow for body biasing injection.
Then, I proposed enhancements for the practice of \bbi, allowing for more reproducible experiments.
Eventually, I set up the first differential fault attack using the Giraud's single bit criterion using \bbi, in addition to bringing insights about the effects of thinning the substrate of integrated circuits on \bbi efficiency.

At the beginning of my work, there were three scientific papers about \bbi.
Therefore, I had a lot of various ways to begin my researches.
Over the past years, other researchers throughout the world have also focused their work and resources on \bbi, such as Colin O'Flynn, who evaluated other very interesting aspects of body biasing injection.
However, it still is, as of today, a little-studied subject when compared to \emfi, and a lot of knowledge has to be unveiled.
