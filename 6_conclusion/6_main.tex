%\section{General conclusion}
Nowadays, fault injection is a major topic when studying hardware security.
Indeed, in the past three decades, numerous new fault injection methods have emerged,
Among them, we can distinguish electromagnetic fault injection, relying on, as its name implies, the creation of parasitic electric current with the help of electromagnetic probes.
It provides a good efficiency while keeping the cost low.
Then, there is laser fault injection, a very effective and efficient fault injection technique relying on the photoelectric effect at work in silicon transistors.
However, it is an expensive technique when compared to others, and requires great mastery of the equipment with acute knowledge.
Eventually, and not to cite them all, body biasing injection was created at the beginning of the years 2010 in my lab.
More recent than the others, it is also a less studied technique.
However, in my thesis, I brought my contributions to this technique.

% as technology nodes advance, and as new fault injection methods emerge, it is required to evaluate deeply their behavior on secure integrated circuits.
